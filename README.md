## Project Report

### Reflection
	During this project i found the whole process very interesting and I learned a lot because I have never used Godot before. I had a lot of trouble debugging the game and finding where I messed up because of my unfamiliarity of the engine. This project helped me understand the simple things a lot better such as how to edit a scene and how to use nodes. It also taught me more specific things like how to change font size and color. The final issue I had was using the command line to connect to git, in the tutorial that Dr. Gestwicki posted the git init command would not work. I ended up just having to update my command line tools, but it took me a long time to figure that out
